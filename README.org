** Issues
- The Job, Application, and Candidate classes have similar static methods. It would be more concise if they inherited all of them from a common ancestor
- Multithreading? A separate routine that job candidates run?
** Demonstration

First we create two jobs:

(The program prints the list of options every time the user has a choice, but I've deleted most of those printouts for conciseness.)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ python main.py
Type 1 if you're in HR, 2 if you want to apply for a job: 1
